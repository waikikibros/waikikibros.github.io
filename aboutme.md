## **Brenden**
My name is Brenden and I was born in 2009. In 2011 I was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor. The following year the tumor was removed and I have been in remission for the last ten years. I am a cancer survior, who at times have difficulties learning things that may seem easy to the normal person. But I work hard and deep down I have a big heart and bigger smile.  

Hobbies
1. Trains
2. Photography
3. Making videos
4. Weight training
