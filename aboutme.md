## **Brenden**
My name is Brenden and I was born in 2009. In 2011 I was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor. The following year the tumor was removed and I have been in remission for the last ten years. I am a cancer survior, who at times have difficulties learning things that may seem easy to the normal person. But I work hard and deep down I have a big heart and bigger smile.  

Hobbies
1. Trains
2. Photography
3. Making videos
4. Weight training

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/) and it will answer **all** your questions.
