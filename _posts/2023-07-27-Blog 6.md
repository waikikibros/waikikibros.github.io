We've been busy being kids this summer. Doing Jiu-Jitsu, going fishing, cutting grass, filming trains and only two weeks left until school returns. I'll be going into 7th grade this year, my brother will be going into 9th grade and my lil-sis wll be in Pre-K. Currently we have three full time six month contracts and we're trying to get to ten by the end of the year. This is one of the homes we did in June, not on contract but a one time cut.
