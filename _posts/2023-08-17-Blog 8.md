This is me and my brothers favorite type of yard to complete, because you get to see it go from over grown to nice and clean. Our phone over heated while making the video even with it in the shade. That's how hot it was on this day, but we managed to get 60% of the vid and edited it down. Music is by Hanu Dixit ~ Song Motel Rock [Video of us](https://youtu.be/radnRKdpr8c).
