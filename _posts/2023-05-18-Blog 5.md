Me and my Bro cutting another neighbors yard. I love the smell of fresh cut grass I can see why so many people like opening up lawn service businesses. Something really satisfying looking at your yard after it's been cut nicely. I'm thinking we need a gas lawn mower during the summer. If the batteries in our lawn tools get to hot they shutdown, so we need to figure out a solution. Yes the batteries needed an hour break to cool off before they began charging. Because of the batteries we are limited to only one cut per day after school. [Video of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8HMjiXfdrE).
